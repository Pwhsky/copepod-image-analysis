Collect data from copepod culture plate images, (copepod crops). This will be the dataset, select a handful of crops 

Train VAE using this dataset to capture the high-dimensional distribution of the data.

Sample points from the latent space, feed to decoder to 
	transform into (hopefully) new copepod crops.

Plot latent space with scatter plot
